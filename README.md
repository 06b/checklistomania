# Checklistomania

This tool is a checklist manager with some neat-O features:
* Focus on what is actionable: central page is a simple list of things you can take action on now, in order of urgency.
* Checklists are centrally defined, allowing any member to subscribe to the authoritative checklist
* Checklist items deadlines can be set according to a fixed date or relative to completion of other items
* All members of team can view other peoples checklists, so admins can see everyone's status at a glance
* Future feature: email reminders for items nearing deadline
